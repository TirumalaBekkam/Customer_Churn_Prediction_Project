# Customer_Churn_Prediction_Project

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn in the telecom sector** using **machine learning techniques**. In the telecom industry, acquiring new customers is often more expensive than retaining existing ones. Therefore, predicting which customers are likely to churn helps businesses improve **customer retention strategies** and optimize marketing efforts.

## 🚀 Project Overview

* **Business Problem**: Identify factors influencing customer churn and predict whether a customer will leave the service.
* **Dataset**: Telecom customer data with demographic, usage, and service-related attributes.
* **Goal**: Build a predictive model to classify customers as *Churn* or *Not Churn*.

## 🔑 Key Steps

* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling).
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for insights.
* Feature selection and correlation analysis.
* Model training using algorithms such as **Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression**.
* Model evaluation with metrics like **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Google Colab**

## 📈 Outcome

The final model provides predictions on customer churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to reduce churn and improve retention strategies.
